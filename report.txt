----> Are you watertight?

Added validators for year, title, developer, genre, box_art_url
	---> To ensure each of those are present

Aded validator for year
	---> That says that ensure a games release date is after 2010 as that was the release year for the applicable console

Used validator on rating to ensure it will have one decimal place

And added a validators that check is the box art url links to an image


Performed unit testing on the entries in the games table

-->All works as expected
